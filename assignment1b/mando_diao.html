		<h3>Me and Mando Diao</h3>
		<p>The first Mando Diao song I heard is "To China with Love". It has a eye-catching name. The rhythm is very catchy and funky. It's lyric is jumpy and funny. I fell in love with it at once.</p>
		<p>The first Mando Diao live I went to is in Beijing in the winter of 2018. Mando Diao's fanbase largely located in China and Japan so they love to go east on their journey. The livehouse is all packed, I was standing at the far corner of the stage while still get shocked by the stage porformance and contagion. I still remember when they are porforming the song "Dance With Somebody", the full house start to jumping with the beat. It was unforgetable.</p>
